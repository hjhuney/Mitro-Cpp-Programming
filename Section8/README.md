# Section 8 Notes: Statements + Operators

### Initialization vs Assignment

Initialization happens when variable is declared for 1st time. 

``` 
int num1 {10}; // this is initialization
```

Assigning happens when you change a value that already exists.

```
num1 = 100; // this is assignment
```

### Chaining Assignment Operators Together

```
int num1 {10};
int num2 {20);

// chain assignment operators together
num1 = num2 = 1000l;
```
